  author:       "Jaipriya Narahari"      # Your name
  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "ALU is 6-bit,synchronous with 16 bit opcode"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "VHDL"  # other examples include Verilog, SystemVerilog, Amaranth, etc
  clock_hz:     100000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_vhdl_ALU_top"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.

  # WARNING: VHDL support in Tiny Tapeout is experimental. The template may get changes during
  #          the shuttle and VHDL support may be dropped for future shuttles if we see low usage.
